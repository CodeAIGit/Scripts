## üîç Understanding the Output

### Sync Rule Types
- **üì• Inbound Rules** - Control data flow from on-premises AD to metaverse
- **üì§ Outbound Rules** - Control data flow from metaverse to Azure AD
- **[CUSTOM]** - Rules created or modified by administrators
- **[OUT-OF-BOX]** - Default Microsoft-provided rules

### Health Status Indicators
- **‚úÖ Good** - All systems operating normally
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning** - Minor issues that should be addressed
- **‚ùå Critical** - Serious problems requiring immediate attention

### Rule Configuration
- **Precedence** - Lower numbers = higher priority (0 is highest)
- **Object Types** - user, group, contact, device, etc.
- **Link Types** - Join (match existing) or Provision (create new)
- **Scope Filters** - Conditions that determine which objects are processed
- **Transformations** - How attributes are mapped and modified

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### PowerShell 7 Compatibility Error
```
Error: Could not load type 'System.Web.Util.Utf16StringValidator'
```
**Solution:** Use Windows PowerShell 5.1 instead of PowerShell 7
```powershell
# Use this instead of pwsh.exe
powershell.exe -File ".\EntraConnect-HealthCheck.ps1"
```

#### Module Not Found
```
Error: The ADSync module is not available
```
**Solution:** Run on the Azure AD Connect server where ADSync module is installed

#### Access Denied
```
Error: Access to the path is denied
```
**Solution:** Run PowerShell as Administrator
